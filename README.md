# Cooperative Training
Experiment Code for Paper ``CoT: Cooperative Training for Generative Modeling''

![](./figure/cot.png)
## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* tensorflow >= 1.6.0
## Introduction
We propose a new paradigm of algorithm for training tractable explicit density generative models like RNN language models.

The research paper [CoT: Cooperative Training for Generative Modeling of Discrete Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03782) is now available on arXiv and has been submitted to NIPS 2018 as a conference paper.
## Usage
We reproduce example codes to repeat the synthetic Turing test experiment with evaluations of NLL<sub>test</sub>, NLL<sub>oracle</sub>, balanced NLL and JSD(P || G) by the oracle model.
